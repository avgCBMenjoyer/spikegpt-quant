Prehistoric man sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave in modern day France 36,000 years ago. Now, with the help of cutting-edge technology, those works of art in the Chauvet-Pont-dâ€™Arc Cave have been reproduced to create the biggest replica cave in the world. The manmade cavern named the Caverne du Pont-dâ€™Arc has been built a few miles from the original site in Vallon-Pont-Dâ€™arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings as well as around 450 bones and other features...
